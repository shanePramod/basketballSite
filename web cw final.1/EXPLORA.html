		<h1 style="color: white;background-color:black;">History of Basketball</h1>
		<p>	The game of basketball as it is known today was created by canadian Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in 
			Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months and a less injury-prone sport 
			than football. Naismith was 31 years old and he was a physical education instructor at YMCA International 
			Training School (now known as Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his 
			boss, Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather.
			<br></br>			
			It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided 
			his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. 
			The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the 
			gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve 
			the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed. 
			<br></br>
			The first public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892.

		<h1 style="color: white;background-color:black;">Rules & Regulations</h1>
		<p>	The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing 
			the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the 
			opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way 
			is called a shot. A successful shot is worth two points, or three points 
			if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in) 
			from the basket in international games and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in 
			NBA games. A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line 
			after a foul is made. After a team has scored from a field goal or free 
			throw, play is resumed with a throw-in awarded to the non-scoring team 
			taken from a point beyond the endline of the court where the points(s) 
			were scored. The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball 
			and the court.The size of the basketball is also regulated. For men, the 
			official ball is 29.5 inches (75 cm) in circumference (size 7, or a "295 ball") 
			and weighs 22 oz (623.69 grams). If women are playing, the official basketball 
			size is 28.5 inches (72 cm) in circumference (size 6, or a "285 ball") with a 
			weight of 20 oz (567 grams).
			<br></br>			
			A regulation basketball court in international games is 91.9 feet (28.0 meters)
			long and 49.2 feet (15 meters) wide. In the NBA and NCAA the court is 94 by 50 
			feet (29 by 15 meters).
			<br></br>
			The basket is a steel rim 18 inches (46 cm) diameter with an attached net affixed 
			to a backboard that measures 6 by 3.5 feet (1.8 by 1.1 meters) and one basket is 
			at each end of the court. The white outlined box on the backboard is 18 inches (46 cm) 
			high and 2 feet (61 cm) wide. At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim 
			is exactly 10 feet (3.05 meters) above the court and 4 feet (1.22 meters) inside the baseline.
			<br></br>
		<h4 style="color:white; font-family:calibri">Playing regulations</h4>
		<p>	Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA)[36] or 12 minutes (NBA).[37] College men's 
			games use two 20-minute halves,[38] college women's games use 10-minute quarters,[39] and most 
			United States high school varsity games use 8-minute quarters; however, this varies from state 
			to state. 15 minutes are allowed for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA, and NCAA rules and 10
			minutes in United States high schools. Overtime periods are five minutes in length except for 
			high school, which is four minutes in length. Teams exchange baskets for the second half. The 
			time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active. Therefore, 
			games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time, typically about two hours.
			Five players from each team may be on the court at one time.
			<br></br>
			The game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in the NBA),
			one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the NBA) and the table officials. For college, the NBA,
			and many high schools, there are a total of three referees on the court. The table officials are 
			responsible for keeping track of each team's scoring, timekeeping, individual and team fouls, player 
			substitutions, team possession arrow, and the shot clock.

		<h1 style="color: white;background-color:black;">Common Techniques & Practices</h1>
		<h4 style="color:white; font-family:calibri">Positions</h4>
		<p>	Point guard (often called the "1") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's o
			ffense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.
			<br>
			Shooting guard (the "2") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards 
			the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.
			<br>
			Small forward (the "3") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and 
			dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.
			<br>
			Power forward (the "4"): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under
			the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).
			<br>
			Center (the "5"): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.

		<h4 style="color:white; font-family:calibri">Strategies</h4>
		<p>	Shooting<br>
			Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.
			The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist 
			fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through.<br>
			The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot. Another common shot is called the lay-up. 
			Another shot that is becoming common  is the "circus shot".A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as 
			an air ball.<br>			
			The hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, lay-up or jump shot.
			<br></br>
			Rebounding<br>
			The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it 
			rebounds from the hoop or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. 
			There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change 
			possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are 
			defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.
			<br></br>
			Passing<br>
			A pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are 
			followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.<br>
			A staple pass is the chest pass. The ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest.<br>
			Another type of pass is the bounce pass. Here, the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest 
			to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver.<br> 
			The overhead pass is used to pass the ball over a defender. The ball is released while over the passer's head.<br>
			The outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound. The next pass after the rebound is the outlet pass.<br>
			A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. This is called a no-look pass.<br>
			Another advanced style of passing is the behind-the-back pass, which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball 
			behind the passer's back to a teammate.
			<br></br>
			Dribbling<br>
			Dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball.
			To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control.<br>
			It is important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.

		<div id="div4" class="NBA">
		<h1 style="color: white;background-color:black;">NBA (National Basketball Association)</h1>
		<p>	The National Basketball Association (NBA) is an American men's professional basketball league. It is composed of 30 teams (29 in the 
			United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. It is widely
			considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. 
			<br>
			The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). It changed its name to the 
			National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL). The NBA's regular
			season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June. As of 2015, NBA 
			players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player. 
			<br>
			The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[5] which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation)
			as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The league's several international as well as individual team offices are 
			directed out of its head offices in Midtown Manhattan, while its NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in 
			Secaucus, New Jersey.
			<br>
			The NBA is the third wealthiest professional sport league after the NFL and the MLB by revenue.
